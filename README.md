📝 Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience in working with MongoDB databases and building flexible full-stack applications. By using Next.js, Next Auth, TailwindCSS, Prisma, Axios, and SWR, I was able to build a modern and responsive front-end interface that interacts seamlessly with the MongoDB backend database. This project also allowed me to improve my skills in authentication, data fetching and caching, and overall full-stack development.
